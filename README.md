# Welcome to the portfolio website

This repository is my attempt to make my own portfolio website which will have all my contacts and detailed description of my projects. You can check out the website [here](https://vvyomjjain.github.io).

## Current features
Currently the live version of the website has the following features:
- A cool responsive homepage
- Links to all my social media outlets (*Almost)
- Link to my latest resume

## Upcoming features
Though the site has very limited functionality, but I am commited to add the below features as soon as possible:
- An about page which will list my career goals and objectives along with interests and skills
- A projects page which will have all the details about my projects as a part of my college studies and like
- A contact me page for business and other enquiries
- A separate blog sort of thing for kaggle and other **ML** related projects

I actually don't know how to implement the 'contact me' functionality as I see on many websites, any sort of help will be appreciated.
